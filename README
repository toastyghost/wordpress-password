  WordPress Password Module for Drupal 7.x
============================================

There's not much to it.  Copy the records over with a SQL statement
(field mapping is fairly obvious from nomenclature), being sure to
include the WordPress password hash as a key-value pair called 'wp_pass'
in Drupal's serialized user.data column.  The module does the rest.

The migration script I used was for a site with database hackery done
to its WP installation, so it won't work with standard installations.
I will modify and release it as a separate user migration module at
some point, but it's not really a priority.
